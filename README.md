#### _Capstone Planning for Epicodus, 5.10.2019_

#### By _**Young Liu**_

## Description

_Planning diagrams, mockups, component trees, etc. for my Capstone project._

**Name of Student:** Young Liu

**Name of Project:** Weather Warner? (TBD)

**Project&#39;s purpose or goal:** A mobile app that will provide weather warnings for where it predicts you are going (not just where you are atm)

**List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:** The app will provide warning notifications for inclement weather where it predicts you will be in the future based on the direction and speed you are traveling at.

**What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.**

- React Native
- Android SDK
- Android Emulator
- Dark Sky API
- Backup weather APIs
  - National Weather Service
  - Open Weather Map

**If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.**

- Further improve UI to follow Material Design principles
- Machine learning to predict location rather than just some sort of linear regression
- Monitoring/diagnostic tools to log bugs that users encounter

**What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?**
